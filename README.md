Module1 Open ended project

My project is a random movie generator that takes the top 100 movies of all time from IMDb
and randomly picks one using the current time and displays this for the user.  

I ran out of time and was not able to add reprompt to the user for another movie.

I believe that I should get around 45 points on this assignment.  I did not completely
finish, but all of the code that I have currently works perfectly.
