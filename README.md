Module1 Open ended project

CS 120 Module 2 Open-Ended Project
For this project, you will design, implement, test, and use a C++ project with concepts from Module 2.
Requirements

  * Your README.md file should include:
    * Your name(s)
      * Wyatt Chrisman
    * A summary of your program, including a list of Module 2 concepts used 
      * 
    * Any known bugs at time of submission 
      * 
    * Future work (how you could expand the program with more time)
      * 
    * Citations for any code not written by you or the instructor 
    * The grade you think you have earned, based on the grading rubric below, with justification
    |Module 2 Topic Added||
  * Your main program should have a clear and complex purpose. The goals and functionality of your program should inform the development and design of your class(es) and other concepts. You are highly encouraged to plan and design your main.cpp functionality before writing your other files. Put an add_executable line in CMakeLists.txt to create an executable for your main program. The program should be interactive and all user input must be validated.

  Module 2 Concept Menu
  You can include any combination of these C++ concepts from Module 2: • Inheritance class relationship
  • Component class relationship
  • File input and/or output
  All of the concepts that you use in your main program must be clearly listed in your README.md file.
